# attiny85_temp_rgb
Goal is to lights up an RGB led according the the measured temperature using ATTiny85.
The whole project should fit in a bottle cap, so it will light the water inside.
The colors transitions are smooth between each color.

## Motivation

The main challenge in this project, aside the form factor, is that the ATTiny85 has only 2 native hardware PWM pins, but for a complete control of the color, you need 3.
Other than that it is just a nice decorative project to "artistically" show the measured temperature.
Addition to the project might include utilizing the last available I/O pin for capacitive button in order to put it in and out of sleep.
The intention is to use LIR2023 battery which is a coin size rechargable 3.6v battery, that should suffice to power up all components.

## Required hardware

- ATTiny85
- LIR2032
- DS18b20 Temperature sensor
- 4.7K Ohm Resistor
